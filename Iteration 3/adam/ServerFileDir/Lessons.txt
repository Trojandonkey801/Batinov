1 Thermodynamics | Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat and
temperature, and their relation to energy, work, radiation, and properties of bodies of 
matter. The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics, 
irrespective of the specific composition of the material or system in question. The laws of
thermodynamics are explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics.
Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, especially 
physical chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. Historically, 
thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the efficiency of early steam engines,
particularly through the work of French physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot (1824) 
who believed that engine efficiency was the key that could help France win the Napoleonic 
Wars.[1] Scots-Irish physicist Lord Kelvin was the first to formulate a concise definition 
of thermodynamics in 1854[2] which stated, "Thermo-dynamics is the subject of the relation 
of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of bodies, and the relation of heat to 
electrical agency."The initial application of thermodynamics to mechanical heat engines 
was extended early on to the study of chemical compounds and chemical reactions. 
Chemical thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of 
chemical reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of the field.
Other formulations of thermodynamics emerged in the following decades. Statistical 
thermodynamics, or statistical mechanics, concerned itself with statistical predictions 
of the collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior. In 1909, 
Constantin Carathéodory presented a purely mathematical approach to the field in his 
axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics, a description often referred to as geometrical 
thermodynamics.
